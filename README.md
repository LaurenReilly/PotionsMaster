# REMEDIAL POTIONS
### With Professor Snape

You're pretty bad at potions and Snape knows it. Fortunately for you, you're one of Dumbledore's favorites and he really wants you to excel on your OWLS. As a favor for Dumbledore, Professor Snape has agreed (reluctantly) to allow you into his classroom after hours for some potions practice. He's got a table of ingredients for you to choose from as he instructs you in making potions. Work quickly because Professor Snape doesn't have all day! Oh and do try to ignore the terrible things he says to you,he's just bitter.
